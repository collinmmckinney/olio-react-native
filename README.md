# Setting Up
Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
Set up olio-graphcool and copy the Simple API endpoint into App.js.
Then, run `react-native run-ios` to start the app.

# Notes
App is not set up for Android use yet, but should be doable. Some installation required for some of the dependencies (e.g., react-native-maps).
API keys are hard-coded, need to be loaded securely.

APIs:
AccuWeather API
